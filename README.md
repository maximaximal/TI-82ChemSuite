# TI-82 ChemSuite Project

A program to handle chemistry assignments in a better way. 

## Builds & Downloads

When a new version is ready, the build will be uploaded as aa new release on github. Until then, you can
compile the code by yourself using the compile.bat script (or the sourcecode of our compiler and make, if you aren't on windows).

This project is currently mainly done in a windows programming environment, because the offizial tools fo the TI-82 are windows only. 
Other build methods can follow in the future.

## Compiler (tibasic.exe)

The compiler is a modified version of the TIBasic compiler on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tibasic/. The modified code is hosted at sourceforge
too, under this address: http://sourceforge.net/u/maximaximal/tibasic/ci/master/tree/

This modified compiler version enables us to use more advanced commands like 
include, use comments as descriptions in our source-files and indenting. More features
will be coming in the future.

## Program Planning

Planning is done at a (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1re47MPaEDtquFhziMC5AIkDIJBxpZnwZsL6nwT_DZ18/edit?usp=sharing)[google drive document] to 
make the writing and changes more dynamic. Everybody can comment in that document.

Planning is done in German and English. The languages are mixed together, because this document is made mainly for
the core developers. English is favored though and will, in the long run, replace German, to make
this project more open to a greater audience.
